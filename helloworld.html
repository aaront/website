      <h2>Hello World</h2>
      <h2> by Matthew Barlowe</h2>
      <br />
      <p>"Hello World" is a very common first program for just about any
      programming langauge. I'm sure there's some history behind it, but
      I've never bothered to look it up. Usually it's just a simple program
      of very limited lines that prints out the phrase "Hello World." The
      purpose of this tutorial is to get you setup to write that first
      program.</p>
      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <p>The first thing to do is open your favorite text editor. I use NeoVim
      which is based on Vim a text editor that comes with Unix. Vim is know for
      being dificult if you aren't used to it, but there are many others out
      there: Nano and Emacs come with the MacOS Unix as well, you could use
      Atom which is built by Github, or even plain old TextEdit. The main
      thing is to use something that won't add extra unseen characters to
      what you type like a word processor such as Microsoft Word or Apple
      Pages.</p>
      <p>Once you have your text editor open type these lines into them:
      <pre><code class='python'>
#!/usr/bin/env python3

if __name__=="__main__":
    print("Hello World")
      </code></pre>
      Once that is done save your file as <code>helloworld.py</code> and exit the text editor if you are using
      a terminal editor and type <code>python3 helloworld.py</code> which will
      produce this output:
      <pre><code class='python'>
Hello World
      </code></pre>
      Congratulations, you've just written your first python program! Obviously,
      there's a lot more to it than this but even in just this simple program
      you can learn a lot.</p>
      <h2>Breaking Down the Code</h2>
      <p>Ok let's look at the code and see what's going on in this program. The first
      line of the code is what's called a shebang line. This isn't unique to
      python scripts but is common in the Linux/Unix environment. A shebang line
      tells the shell what type of interpreter to use to process the text of the
      file. You can read more about shebangs and their use in *nix envronments
      <a href='https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Shebang'>at this site</a>. Basically,
      this line is telling Unix what type of python to use to run the script.</p>
      <p>If you have followed my other tutorials you may be asking now, "Why did
      you list <code>/usr/bin/env</code> instead of <code>/usr/bin/local</code>
      where our Homebrewed python3 is located? An excellent question. The reason
      we use <code>/usr/bin/env</code> instead of where our python is actually located
      is because <code>env</code> is an actual Unix command that will create
      an environment using the environment variables and then run the program passed
      to it in the arguments which in this case is python3.</p>
      <p>So the <code>env</code> will then use the <code>$PATH</code> variable, the
      same one mentioned in the Homebrew tutorial, of the environment
      and go down the directories on that <code>$PATH</code>until it finds the
      right directory of the program which it then executes. To sum it all up
      it just makes your code more portable because it will search that computer
      to find where <code>python</code> is to exectue the script.
