      <h2>Introduction to PostgreSQL</h2>
      <h2> by Matthew Barlowe</h2>
      <br />
      <p>Ok this is the first in a series of SQL tutorials I will be releasing. This tutorial will
      cover the basics of getting Postgres setup on your computer and running. We won't actually
      be working with in data in this article, but instead the focus is on the nuts and bolts
      of what Postgres is and and its structure. But before I get into all that let's start
      at the beginning. As always these tutorials will be focused on working in a Mac OS X
      environment. The Postgres commands and the SQL syntax should work no matter what, but
      the details of installing will definitely be different on a Windows system.</p>
      <h2>What is SQL?</h2>
      <p>SQL, or sequel as its commonly pronounced, is bascially an acronym that stands for
      Structured Querying Language. SQL has been around forever since 1974 and isn't anywhere
      near cutting edge in technology. Some may see this as a drawback, but it also has its
      advantages as well. One being that it's a well documented system and language, and two
      is that most people are at least somewhat familiar with its terminology.</p>
      <p>But what does SQL do? Well SQL is the language used to query and manipulate data
      in a relational database system. And a relational database system is a system that uses
      the relational model; a model consisting of unique keys to create
      relations between different tables on the database. Its not really important you
      understand this all right now but just keep it in mind for future tutorials.</p>
      <h2>What is Postgres?</h2>
      <p>Postgres is just a flavor of SQL. I chose this one for several reasons. One being
      it is noted for its speed, and secondly because it is open source and therefore free.
      There are plenty other choices out there such as MySQL or SQLite3 that are perfectly
      suitable, but these tutorials will focus on Postgres as it is the one I am most comfortable
      using. There are differences between these options, but the basic commands we
      wil go over in this series should be universal between all of these systems, however I can't
      speak for all of them as there may be slight differences in syntax.</p>
      <p>Still the majority of the lessons learned using Postgres and these tutorials will
      be portable. Especially the ideas behind <code>JOIN</code> and how keys create
      relations between tables.</p>
      <h2>Installing Postgres</h2>
      <p>To get Postgres onto our system we are going to use Homebrew to install the files. If
      you don't have Homebrew please refer to this <a href='homebrew.html'>tutorial</a> to get
      it up and running. So like our other brew installations, Postgres is installed with a
      command you may find familiar if you've been following these tutorials.</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
$ brew install postgresql
      </code></pre>
      <p>And you'll see a whole bunch of text on the screen showing Homebrew installing the
      Postgres files. It's often a good idea to skim this output even if you don't understand
      it as sometimes the output will have very important info. When installing Postgres this
      is one of those times. Because at the bottom it will give you two commands
