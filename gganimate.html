      <h2>Introduction to GGanimate and Plotting PbP Events</h2>
      <h2>by Jake Flancer</h2>
      <br />
      <p><i>Editor's note: This piece was written by Jake Flancer
        a large contributor to the
        <a href='https://tapetotapetracker.com/#!/login'>Tape 2 Tape</a>
        project. His other work can be found
        <a href='http://threepointgames.blogspot.com'>here</a> and you
        can follow him on twitter <a href='https://twitter.com/jakef1873'>
          @jakef1873</a></i></p>.
      <p>In this tutorial I’ll be covering how to set up gganimate,
      and then I’ll walk through how to create this graphic. This tutorial
      will be using the R programming language. I will explain everything
      as if you are relatively new with R, but it will be more clear
      depending on your experience. I’ll also assume you understand
      general syntax and how to run code, but if something is still
      unclear I’d be happy to explain it.</p>
      <p>There are several useful tutorials for gganimate available online,
      but most used the same default example. While they are helpful,
      I thought it would be fun to introduce a new application
      relevant to hockey.</p>
      <h2>Installing gganimate</h2>
      <p>Gganimate is an extension to the popular graphing package ggplot2,
      which allows users to create animated visuals of their data.
      To use gganimate, you first have to install
      <a href='https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php'>ImageMagick</a>,
      a command-line program for image editing. There are several
      ways to do this, but I’ll be going through what I found
      easiest on a macOS system. To do this, you must first set up
      Homebrew, which is a helpful package manager. If you don’t have
      Homebrew already installed, a <a href='homebrew.html'>tutorial</a>
      has already been created for this process.
      <p>Once Homebrew is installed, you can simply type:</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
brew install imagemagick
      </code></pre>
      <p>into your console (terminal). Once this is prepared,
      run the following code in the R terminal and gganimate
      will be downloaded available for use.</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
if(!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dgrtwo/gganimate")
      </code></pre>
      <h2>Background Setup</h2>
      <p>We will be working with NHL play-by-play data,
      which can be retrieved using Emmanuel Perry’s scraper.
      The code can be found
      <a href='https://github.com/mcbarlowe/tutorialscode/blob/master/Rscraper/Manny_scraper_HTM.R'>
        here</a>, and a
      <a href='NHLscrape.html'>tutorial</a> for working
      with this file can be found here. For this tutorial,
      you will only load a single game of data and will not
      need to save it. As a result, I’d recommend deleting
      or commenting out all lines from 3116
      <code>library(readr)</code> to the end of the file.</p>
      <p>To graph the events, we need to use a rink.
      Prashanth Iyer has already made code to create a rink in ggplot,
      which can be found
      <a href='https://github.com/mcbarlowe/graphautomation/blob/master/RinkFunction.R'>here</a>.
      I’ll revisit this in a little. At this point, all extraneous
      steps have been finished, and the rest of the tutorial
      will simply require following along code in R.</p>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>This has already been mentioned, but just to reiterate,
      the first step is to load all necessary packages into R.
      The tidyverse package is actually a group of packages,
      and for this tutorial we’ll only be using ‘dplyr’ for
      data manipulation and ‘ggplot2’ for graphing. However, it
      is much easier to load them all at once. Additionally,
      be sure to load the ‘gganimate’ and ‘animation’
      packages that I covered earlier.</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
library(tidyverse)
library(gganimate)
library(animation)
      </code></pre>
      <p>At this point, I’d also recommend loading Prashanth’s
      rink information. Run the command below to do this,
      except change the file location.</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
source('/Users/jake/Documents/R/RinkFunction.R')
      </code></pre>
      <p>The next step is to open and run the entire scraper file.
      You don’t need to worry about the contents of the file,
      just make sure that it is being loaded in the same
      environment that you will be using to run the rest of the
      code. At this point, you’re current environment should
      have a dataframe named ‘ds.espn_codes’ and a list named
      ‘rink’, as well as several values and functions.</p>
      <p>Next, we will be manually setting a few values.
      After this there is no code that will need to be changed.
      To select a specific game, manually enter the season in
      the same format as below. To the best of my knowledge,
      the easiest way to find a game ID is to look in the URL
      of the game’s box score on nhl.com. For example, the url of
      game 2 of the Finals is:
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
https://www.nhl.com/gamecenter/wsh-vs-vgk/2018/05/30/2017030412/recap/box-score#game=2017030412,game_state=final,lock_state=final,game_tab=boxscore”
      </code></pre>
      <p>In this text, we can see the “30412” that is typed below.
      As some general rules, regular season games start with a ‘2’
      and playoff games start with a ‘3’. The third digit ‘4’,
      represents the round in the playoffs.
      I’m not completely clear about the rest of the code,
      but I’m sure there’s a method to the madness.</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
Season &lt- "20172018"
game_ID &lt- "30412"
      </code></pre>
      <p><i>Editors Note: the NHL game code consists of three distinct parts.
        Take for example 2017030412 in the url above.
        The first four digits represent the year in which the season
        starts. So for this season it's 2017 and for last season it
        would be 2016. The next two digits represent the type of
        game being played: 01 is preseason, 02 are regular season
        games, and 03 represent playoff games. In regular and preseason
        games the numbers after those two digits represent the numbered
        game in that season. The total games in an NHL season is now
        1271. Before Vegas's addition it was 1230. </i></p>
      <p><i>In the playoffs the digits after the 03 aren't the running
        total of games. As jake said above the next two digits
        represent which round of the playoffs the game takes place in.
        First round would be 01, second 02, etc. The next digit represents
        which series in the round the game takes place in. In the finals
        there's only one series so it will always be a one, but if it was
        a first round game the digit could range from 1 to 8 and would shrink
        according to the round. The next digit represents which game
        in that series is taking place. This can only range from 1 to 7.</i></p>
      <p>The final variable, ‘interval’, specifies the amount of seconds
      each frame represents. At 30, the frame is updated every 30 seconds.
      This can be made larger or smaller, but I’d caution against making it
      too small. The way gganimate works is by basically combining a bunch
      of .jpg files into a .gif. At a 30 second interval, the computer is
      asked to create 120 files. This takes some time and depending on
      your computer I wouldn’t recommend making it any larger.</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
interval &lt- 30
      </code></pre>
      <p>The next line uses a function from the scraper file to save
      game information in the ‘pbp_file’ variable. The information
      by default is stored as a list, so ‘[[1]]’ is needed to extract the data frame.</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
pbp_file &lt- ds.compile_games(games = game_ID,
                             season = Season,
                             pause = 2,
                             try_tolerance = 5,
                             agents = ds.user_agents)[[1]]

      </code></pre>
      <p>The pbp_file is stored as a data frame, which stores information
      as rows and columns. Each row indicates an individual event from
      the game, and each column provides information about the event.
      Using the colnames() command, we can get an idea about the type
      of data we’ll be working with:</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
colnames(pbp_file)
 [1] "season"              "game_id"             "game_date"           "session"
 [5] "event_index"         "game_period"         "game_seconds"        "event_type"
 [9] "event_description"   "event_detail"        "event_team"          "event_player_1"
[13] "event_player_2"      "event_player_3"      "event_length"        "coords_x"
[17] "coords_y"            "players_substituted" "home_on_1"           "home_on_2"
[21] "home_on_3"           "home_on_4"           "home_on_5"           "home_on_6"
[25] "away_on_1"           "away_on_2"           "away_on_3"           "away_on_4"
[29] "away_on_5"           "away_on_6"           "home_goalie"         "away_goalie"
[33] "home_team"           "away_team"           "home_skaters"        "away_skaters"
[37] "home_score"          "away_score"          "game_score_state"    "game_strength_state"
[41] "highlight_code"
      </code></pre>
      <p>Next, we will be storing some information in strings for easier use later in the code:</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
home_team &lt;- pbp_file$home_team[1]
away_team &lt;- pbp_file$away_team[1]
date &lt;- pbp_file$game_date[1]
max_period &lt;- max(pbp_file$game_period)
      </code></pre>
      <h2>Data Formatting</h2>
      <p>Now we need to prepare the play-by-play information for display.
      This will be done using the aforementioned ‘dplyr’ package.
      The ‘%&lt;%’ is referred to as the pipe operator and allows you to
      apply functions in an easier to read and interpret format.
      The first function used is ‘filter’. By using the ‘%in%’ function
      we can choose only unblocked shot events. The second function, ‘select’,
      chooses the relevant columns we’ll be working with.</p>
      <p>The final function is mutate, which allows us to create new columns.
      The first column ‘flip’, stores either 1 or -1 to change the coordinates
      to the correct side of the ice. This works by using the modulus “mod”
      operator to return true (-1) if the period is an even number, and false
      (1) if the period is an odd number. The next two columns ‘x’ and ‘y’ puts
      each time on its own side of the ice by multiplying the coordinate by the flip.
      I also need to use the<code>as.numeric(as.character())</code> functions
      because the coordinates are originally stored as factors. The final new
      column is ‘time_bin’, which uses the integer division operator to set the
      bin for each event. This essentially just rounds down the number created
      in usual numeric division. For example, a shot 13 seconds into the game
      is given a value of 0 (13/30) and a shot 100 seconds into the game
      is given a value of 3 (100/30).</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
      game_file &lt;- pbp_file %&gt;%
  filter(event_type %in% c('SHOT','MISS','GOAL')) %&gt;%
  select(game_seconds,
         event_type,
         event_team,
         coords_x,
         coords_y,
         home_score,
         away_score,
         home_team,
         away_team,
         game_strength_state,
         game_period) %&gt;%
  mutate(flip = ifelse(as.numeric(game_period)%%2 == 0,-1,1),
         x = as.numeric(as.character(coords_x)) * flip,
         y = as.numeric(as.character(coords_y)) * flip,
         time_bin = (game_seconds%/%interval)
         )
      </code></pre>
      <p>This next part might get a little confusing, but hopefully I explain it clearly.
      Many 30 second intervals of a hockey game do not include any shot attempts, but
      we don’t want the animation to simply skip around to each attempt. I chose
      to set up the gif as a function of time, so it counts up every 30 seconds. This
      means that we want a frame to be displayed regardless of if any attempts were
      taken in that time. For example, no shots were taken between 13 and 100 seconds
      in our game. This means we are missing two bins for the times between 30-59 seconds
      and 60-89 seconds. Instead of skipping these frames, we need to add in rows with
      limited information to make sure the gif includes these frames.</p>
      <p>To start, we create an empty dataframe with a row for each 30 second interval
      possible in the game and the same columns as our game_file. Next, we fill the
      time_bin column with each possible bin in a game. With 30 second intervals,
      there are time bins from 0-119 (120 half-minute groups). Additionally,
      we use the ‘rep()’ command to fill the game_period column with the period
      for each bin. Using 30 second intervals, there are 40 bins in each period.</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
min_game &lt;- data.frame(matrix(NA,
                              nrow = (1200/interval)*max_period,
                              ncol = ncol(game_file)))
colnames(min_game) &lt;- colnames(game_file)
min_game$time_bin &lt;- 0:((1200/interval)*max_period - 1)
min_game$game_period &lt;- rep(1:max_period, each = (1200/interval))
      </code></pre>
      <p>Using the ‘which()’ function, we can now filter only the time bins in the
      blank dataframe that are not included in the game information.</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
min_game &lt;- min_game[which(!min_game$time_bin %in% game_file$time_bin),]
      </code></pre>
      <p>Finally, using this methodology, if a game goes into overtime we would
      keep displaying frames after the game has ended. To account for this,
      we can use the following lines, which cuts of the frames when the
      overtime goal is scored.</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
ot_end &lt;- game_file$time_bin[nrow(game_file)]
if(max_period &gt; 3){
  min_game &lt;- filter(min_game, time_bin &lt;= ot_end)
      </code></pre>
      <p>This next command first binds together the game_file
      (which contains the pbp info) and min_game (which contains the empty info).
      Now we use the pipe operator to create columns indicating if the
      events are goals. This will be used to take a running count later on.
      Since the rows from the empty dataframe produce NA values, the next two lines set these at zeros.</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
intervaled_file &lt;- bind_rows(game_file,min_game) %&gt;%
  mutate(home_goal = ifelse(event_type == "GOAL" &amp; event_team == home_team,1,0),
         away_goal = ifelse(event_type == "GOAL" &amp; event_team == away_team,1,0))

intervaled_file$home_goal[is.na(intervaled_file$home_goal)] &lt;- 0
intervaled_file$away_goal[is.na(intervaled_file$away_goal)] &lt;- 0
      </code></pre>
      <p>We need to include this next line because some stadiums record
      data on reverse sides. This is pretty jumbled code, but it basically
      just looks at if the home team started on the left or right side
      of the ice. We want the home team on the left so if it turns out
      on the right orientation is -1.</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
orientation &lt;- ifelse(as.numeric(as.character((
                                    filter(intervaled_file,
                                           event_team == home_team))$coords_x))[1] > 0,-1,1)

      </code></pre>
      <p>Now there isn’t much left to do. We use the pipe operator again
      to prepare the remaining information. First, ‘arrange’ is used
      to sort the data from the beginning to the end of the game- to
      keep track of the score. We now use mutate again to create and
      edit some columns. The coordinates are first updated to the correct
      orientation. The ‘cumsum’ command is used to create a running count
      for the home and away scores (this is why we needed to use arrange).
      Period_min gets the minute of the period, so the 21st minute in the game
      is changed to 1, etc. The final variable, game_time, is what we will
      be using to proceed through the frames and display the time and score
      information. The formatting is a little complicated, but it essentially
      stores the game as a time, where the period is represented as an hour,
      and minutes and seconds are the minutes and seconds into the period.
      It then displays the home and away score on the next line.
      The weird spacing is done so home and away score are formatted
      symmetrically in the center.</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
ntervaled_file &lt;- intervaled_file %&gt;%
  arrange(time_bin) %&gt;%
  mutate(x = x*orientation,
         y = y*orientation,
         home_score = cumsum(home_goal), #takes running count of score
         away_score = cumsum(away_goal),
         period_min = time_bin%%(1200/interval),
         # This creates the time frame and formats the text for display
         game_time = format(as.POSIXct('0001-01-01 00:00:00') +
         period_min*interval + 3600*game_period +
         interval, paste("Period: %H Time: %M:%S",
         "\n                                                                            ",
         home_score,
         "-",
         way_score)))
      </code></pre>
      <p>These are the final lines for data formatting. Basically,
      in the rare chance that a shot, missed shot, or goal don’t
      occur (most frequently a 0-0 game or when looking at a subset
      of the game), we still want the legend to remain the same.
      To do this, we create a dataframe with three completely blank rows,
      except for each event type. These rows are then bound to our main
      data frame and the event type is changed to a factor. Now,
      regardless of the events that actually occur in the game,
      the color legend will remain the same.</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
temp &lt;- as.data.frame(matrix(c(NA,"GOAL",rep(NA,17),
                               NA,"SHOT",rep(NA,17),
                               NA,"MISS",rep(NA,17)),
                             ncol = 19,
                             byrow = T))
colnames(temp) &lt;- colnames(intervaled_file)
intervaled_file &lt;- bind_rows(intervaled_file, temp)
intervaled_file$event_type &lt;- as.factor(intervaled_file$event_type)
      </code></pre>
      <p>Using Prashanth’s code, we first create a blank rink.</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
rink &lt;- fun.draw_rink() + coord_fixed()
      </code></pre>
      <p>Finally, we can put together the graphic. As a quick background,
      ggplot works by adding layers to a graphic. Some layers asks for
      aesthetic (aes) mappings, and others require different parameters.
      First we create a geom_point layer. The aesthetic mapping takes
      the x and y-coordinates stored as x and y from the intervaled_file.
      The color aesthetic is specified as the event type. For those
      familiar with ggplot but not gganimate, these next two aesthetics
      are new. Frame takes in the variable we need to iterate over,
      which in this case is the game_time column. Cumulative specifies
      whether or not we want the previous points to stay, in this
      case we will set that as true. Size makes the points larger, and
      the alpha parameter gives the points a transparency. The next
      layer sets the color scale for the events, I chose to make
      goals green, missed shots light blue, and shots on goal dark blue.
      The labs layer changes the legend title from ‘event_type’ to
      ‘Shot Type’. Finally, the ggtitle layer allows the title to be
      formatted nicer.</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
b &lt;- rink +
  geom_point(data= intervaled_file, aes(x=x,y=y,color = event_type,
             frame = game_time, cumulative = T), size = 4, alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("seagreen","skyblue","navyblue"),
                     labels = c("Goal","Missed Shot","Shot on Goal"),
                     drop = F) +
  labs(color = "Shot Type") +
  ggtitle(paste(home_team,
                "vs",
                away_team,
                date,
                "\n"),
          subtitle = paste("\n                                                                              ",
                           home_team,
                           "                                        ",
                           away_team))
      </code></pre>
      <p>The output <code>Warning: Ignoring unknown aesthetics: frame, cumulative</code>
      should be displayed. Additionally, if you were to enter “b” into
      the console the final graph will be displayed ignoring the gganimate parameters.</p>
      <p>Using the animation package, we can set several features.
      Loop determines how many times the gif loops. The default is 0,
      which infinitely loops the gif. I chose 1, which means the gif
      stops after the game ends. This is a personal preference,
      as I like to look at the complete shot chart after the
      game has finished. The height and width are set so the
      teams and score lines up symmetrically.</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
ani.options(loop = 1, ani.width  = 690, ani.height = 400)
      </code></pre>
      <p>This is the final line of code. The ‘gganimate’ command
      creates and (if you want to) saves the gif. Interval
      determines the speed, I think 0.25 is a good speed but
      you can change that as you’d like. Additionally, I use the
      paste command to name the files so for example,
      “VGKWSH2018-05-30.gif”. I also imagine you’d want to change
      the file location.</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
gganimate(b,
          interval = 0.25,
          filename = paste("~/Documents/R/game_viz/",
                           home_team,
                           away_team,
                           date,
                           ".gif",
                           sep=''))
