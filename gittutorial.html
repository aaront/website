      <h2>Setting Up and Using Git</h2>
      <h2> by Matthew Barlowe</h2>
      <br />
      <p>So if you've started out doing a little coding either for fun or like me
      to try and do data analysis of the NHL, then you've probably heard people
      talk a lot about Git and Github. And if you were like me, you've even tried
      to learn it, or use it, but just got so frustrated you gave up and figured
      it wasn't worth the time.</p>
      <p>Well this article will try to dispel some of those confusions because
      once Git clicks for you, you'll never code without it. It's such a powerful
      tool to fit into your coding arsenal. But before we get into setting up
      Git and using let's talk about what Git is and what it does.</p>
      <h2>What is Git?</h2>
      <p>First off let's differentiate between Git and Github. Many people use
      these terms interchangeably, but they are very different things. Git is
      what is called a Version Control System or VCS. To put it simply its a
      software that just tracks the changes you make to the programs that you
      write. That's all it is at its essence. Like working with a Google doc
      with track changes switched on, Git remembers the changes you make to your files
      and can restore those files to previous states.</p>
      <p>Obviously Git can do a lot more, but don't worry about that
      right now. Now Git itself is self contained to your computer, nobody can
      see your changes except for you. Github on the other hand is a website
      where you can store your code and the history of your changes saved by Git.
      This is where you will send your work when you want to share it with the
      world. So keep that in mind when reading the rest of this article. Git is
      the program on your computer, and Github is the website where you will
      send your code when you want to share it. This also adds the benefit of
      an extra back up in case something happens to your system.</p>
      <h2>Why use Git?</h2>
      <h3>Track Changes</h3>
      <p>Git as noted above keeps track of the changes you've made to your
      code throughout the history of developing if used properly. Everytime I
      add a new feature to my code I save it in Git. And using Git logs I can
      see all the changes I've made. So if I write something and it messes
      everything up I can just go back one step in the Git chain and get things
      back up and running.</p>
      <p>Obviously this may not be a big deal if you are just writing code that
      only you will use yourself. But there's been plenty of times I've made
      changes one night and forgotten what I've done the next day when I go back
      to work on it. But if you are working with multiple people on a project
      then this log of changes is invaluable to see what others have done in
      the code base. Git also keeps track of the date and time of changes
      made as well so you can see who made changes and when those changes
      were made.</p>
      <h3>Branching</h3>
      <p>This is perhaps the most important part about git is that you can
      create branches of the code you are working on in order to fix bugs or
      create new features. You may be asking now, "Why not just create a copy
      of the file and work on two copies?" Well if you're only working on one
      file then you may not need git, but often you'll be working on multiple
      files that often interact with each other.</p>
      <p>Trying to keep track manually
      of the working copies and copies that are being worked on would quickly
      become confusing and could lead to bugs and errors that would you'd have
      to waste futher time tracking down. Git handles all that behind the scenes
      so you don't have to. You can create a new branch and make as many changes
      all without breaking any of the files you are using until you have properly
      tested the new versions.</p>
      <p>To use a personal example I recently added the ability to query goalie
      stats to my twitter bot. Instead of taking the bot down and working on
      the file until the features were added, I created a new branch where I
      worked on the new features until they were finished. Once done, I then
      merged those changes back into my main script.</p>
      <h3>It works with Everything</h3>
      <p>Git is language agnostic. It works with any programming language out
      there whether it's Python, R, C++, or something else, Git doesn't care.
      It tracks all changes for all files no matter what they are. In fact if
      you were just simply writing a novel or a story, Git would track those
      changes just as well as changes to a programming script! It's near
      universiality means it is a common ground for developers to meet and
      collaborate on projects.</p>
      <h2>Setting up Git</h2>
      <p>>The first step to getting Git up and running is to go to <a href='github.com'>Github</a>
      and setup an account. Once that's done open up a terminal screen and we'll
      get started installing Git. If you don't have Hombrew installed on your
      system please head <a href='homebrew.html'>here</a> and read this tutorial
      to get up to date as I'll be using Homebrew to install Git.</p>
      <p>If you have Homebrew installed and running, all you need to do is type
      this at the command line:</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
$ brew install git
      </code></pre>
      <p>Brew does its usual stuff and after its done type <code>which git</code>
      to make sure we are using the git that brew installed. The output should be
      <code>usr/local/bin/git</code> if it is not then we need to change your <code>$PATH</code>
      variable to put the Homebrew version first. To do that type these commands
      one at a time and hit enter after each one:</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
$ echo export PATH='/usr/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
$ source ~/.bash_profile
$ echo $PATH
      </code></pre>
      <p>Withut getting into too much detail about the commands what you are doing there is place
      the <code>usr/local/bin</code> at the front of your <code>$PATH</code> so that the bash
      shell will look there first for the commands you are trying to run. Next we'll run some
      commands to setup git to use the account you just setup on Github when you
      want to push your work to a repository.
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"
$ git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"
      </code></pre>
      <p>"Your Name Here" and "your_email@youremail.com" should be the username you created
      and the email you created it with on Github. After that's done we're going to setup Git
      to save your user name and password to the OSX keychain that way you don't have to type it
      in everytime you want to push something to one of your repositories on Github.</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
$ git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
      </code></pre>
      <p>The first time you push something to a repository you'll have to enter your user name
      and password but after that it will be saved to the OSX keychain and you won't need to enter
      it anymore. Now that we have everything setup lets start creating our first initial
      repository or repo for short. A repository is just a fancy name of where we will
      store our code.
      <h2>Creating Your First Repository</h2>
      <p>Ok lets create a new directory to store our first repo.</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
$ mkdir gittutorial
$ cd gittutorial
$ git init
      </code></pre>
      <p>So with those three commands we created a new directory called <code>gittutorial</code>
      we changed the directory to <code>gittutorial</code> and then we created the repository
      with the <code>git init</code> command. If everything worked correctly you should see
      this text as output:</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/MattBarlowe/gittutorial/.git/
      </code></pre>
      <p>Instead of <code>/Users/MattBarlowe</code> it will be whatever username you are on
      your Mac. So now that we have the repository initialized (init is short for initialize)
      lets look our next command:
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
$ git status
      </code></pre>
      <p>Which will return this:</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
On branch master

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
      </code></pre>
      <p>This is the status of our repository and it tells us three important things.
      The first thing is that we are on branch master. Master is the first branch
      git creates when you initialize the repository. This is the main branch you
      will be working on in any repository. You can rename it if you wanted to, but
      I'd advise against it as its common usage to call it master. This will change
      if you move to other branches in the repository.</p>
      <p>The next line tells us that there have been no changes made to the repository.
      In git speak a 'commit' is where you have saved your changes to git. No commits
      means we haven't made any changes which is to be expected as it's a newly created
      repository. The third line means there are no files that we can even commit/save
      which again as it is a newly created directory shouldn't be surprising.</p>
      <p>So lets create a file using whichever text editor you prefer. I use Vim myself
      but if you want to use Nano or Emacs that's fine as well. But we'll write a
      simple python script show below and then save it as gittutorial.py.</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
for x in range(10):
    print(x)
      </code></pre>
      <p>After you've saved the file exit back out to the command line and run
      <code>git status</code> and you should see this on the command line.</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add file..." to include in what will be committed)

	gittutorial.py

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
      </code></pre>
      <p>As you can see the branch is the same and we still haven't made any commits, but
      now we have a new one of Untracked files. This means that git has noticed we created
      a new file, but git is not currently tracking it either in this commit or past commits.
      As you can read in the output our next command <code>git add</code> will begin the process
      of git tracking our changes. Now type:</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
$ git add gittutorial.py
      </code></pre>
      <p>Nothing will print out but if you type <code>git status</code> again you will see
      this:</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached file..." to unstage)

	new file:   gittutorial.py
      </code></pre>
      <p>So is our file saved? No! At least not yet. All we've done is add the file to the staging area
      so that when we commit the changes to our repository the file will be saved with the commit.
      If you're a little confused don't worry a lot of people are confused over this step. Basically
      what you are doing is telling Git what files you want to save when you actually save the state of
      your repository. When you create a commit Git doesn't know what it needs to keep track of unless
      you tell it the files it needs to track. All <code>git add</code> does is tell git exactly which
      files you want to save.</p>
      <p>So lets actually make our first commit. Type this into the command line:</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
$ git commit -m "First Commit"
      </code></pre>
      <p>So you've made your first commit! The '-m' flag to git commit allows you to add a message to the
      commit so you can describe what you've done. You should always put a message on your commit so you
      or others know what exactly you changed with that commit of the code. The message can be anything but
      its best to keep it short and always put it between quotation marks.</p>
      You have now officially saved the status of your repository
      with git. Think of a commit as taking a snapshot of your code in time. Except unlike a photo, git
      allows you to go back and forth along the timeline of your code, i.e. the branch, and stop at any
      point in time of the development where you made a commmit. So now that we've commited our changes
      lets type <code>git status</code> and see what it tells us.
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
      </code></pre>
      <p>Once we've commited our changes there is nothing more to commit. That is until you make new changes
      and then you'll need to repeat the process over again. Ok let's get some more practice with this.
      Go back into your gittutorial.py file and change the number in the range function to 20 save and then
      exit. Now type in <code>git status</code> and you'll see this:</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add file..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- file..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   gittutorial.py

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
      </code></pre>
      <p>So now that we've made changes to the file we need to <code>git add</code> and then
      <code>git commit -m "Changed number in range from 10 to 20"</code>. And now you have commited
      your changes for the second time to the repository. So let's introduce a new command
      where you can look at the history of your changes.
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
$ git log --oneline
      </code></pre>
      Which will produce this:
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
88e287f (HEAD -> master) Changed number in range from 10 to 20
c9801bb First Commit
      </code></pre>
      <p>This is a log of all the changes you've made so far in this repository. As we've only made
      two changes, there are only two entries. The <code>--oneline</code> shrinks your log down
      into oneline for each entry to make it easier to read. To get more info for each commit
      you can just type <code>git log</code>. Let's go over the output of the log as there
      are several important things in the output.
      <p>The string of numbers at the front of each entry is what's called the SHA. This is a unique
      hash number that is assigned to each commit that keeps track of the commits. It's actually
      much longer than those seven numbers but its shortened for the oneline output. You can search
      log for certain commits if you know their SHA number as well. The next thing is the
      <code>(HEAD -> master)</code>. This shows you where the location of the current branch you have
      checked out. This tells us that we are currently working on the latest commit in the branch.</p>
      <p>Now let's check out one of the most powerful features of git which is creating new branches.
      Branches, and moving back and forth between them, really lie at the heart of what makes Git
      great. Branches allow developers to work independently on the same files and develop different
      features simultaneously. Understanding how they work is the important to understand Git.</p>
      <p>So lets create a new branch which we'll call newbranch because it's late and I don't feel
      very creative.
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
$ git checkout -b newbranch
      </code></pre>
      <p><code>git checkout</code> is the main way one switches between branches in git, however when
      we add the '-b' flag it tells the command to create a new branch name with the name we give it
      and then switch to that branch. If we wanted to switch back to master all we would need to type
      is <code>git checkout master</code>. Now lets got back into our python file and add the line
      <code>print('This is a new feature')</code> after the for loop block and save it. We'll add and
      commit these changes as we did before. To make sure you're on the newbranch make sure to run a
      <code>git status</code> and check.
