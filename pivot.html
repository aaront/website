      <h2>Tableau's Pivot Table Feature</h2>
      <h2> by Matthew Barlowe</h2>
      <br />
      <p>Since everybody enjoyed my intro to Tableau, I've decided to continue writing more tutorials
      about features people may not know about that make working with data much easier.  The first one
      that comes to mind is the use of Pivot Tables in Tableau. If you are familiar with Excel you may
      be familiar with the term Pivot Table; however the Pivot Table in Tableau is not the same. In
      Excel the pivot table is used mainly for group and summarising data while in Tableau uses their
      pivot table to move the data from a wide to a long format and vice versa.  Don't know what that means?
      Don't worry cause we'll be explaining it here shortly. This tutorial assumes that you are familiar
      with the basics of Tableau that I covered in my earlier <a href='tableau.html'>tutorial.</a>
      <h2><b>The Data:</b></h2>
      <p>The data for this came from <a href='https://twitter.com/andidee15?lang=en'>Andi Duroux</a> and
      is used to form her excellently made Tableau dashboard which can be found
      <a href='https://public.tableau.com/profile/andi.duroux#!/vizhome/PlayerEvaluationTool/PlayerEvaluationTool'>here.</a>
      She was kind enough to let me use the data from that dashboard for this tutorial. It was created
      in a very impressive Excel workbook, which if you enjoy those type of things I would definitely ask her
      for it as there's a lot of Excel skills one can learn from that workbook alone. So with data in hand,
      I am going to recreate her workbork and show you how you can use pivot tables and grouping to do the same.
      You can dowload the data from <a href='PivotTutorialData.csv'>here</a> and load it into Tableau
      to follow along. Again, lots of thanks to Andi for allowing us use of her data.
      <h2><b>What Does Pivoting Do?</b></h2>
      <p>Using Tableau's Pivot function pivot's the data from a wide to a long format and vice versa. Ok, so
      what does that actually mean? If you imported the data from the csv into excel you would see something
      like this:</p>
      <div class='fitimage'>
        <img  src='img/widedata.png' alt='A picture of wide data'>
      </div>
      <br />
      <p>This is very common with spreadsheets and data tables because it makes it very easy for people to
      look at the data. It also makes it easier to run calculations such as sum and averages on each observation
      (the rows) and the variables (the columns). However when it comes to converting the data in to a graph
      it can be a hindrance. Esepcially since we are replicating the tableau Dashboard linked above.  The reason
      for that is Tableau considers the columns in this case to be measures instead of dimensions.  We want to group
      our data into different categories and to do that we need to turn our columns into a dimension.</p>
      <p>I touched on the difference between dimensions and measures in my first tutorials, but a brief overview is a dimension
      is a way you want to slice your data while a measure is the value you want to store in that slice.  You can
      read more about it <a href='https://www.evolytics.com/blog/tableau-fundamentals-dimension-vs-measure/'>here.</a>
      Another way to think of it is that the dimensions are your indenpendent variable, and measures the dependent
      variables. With the way the data is setup now the player is the dependent variable which if you plug it
      int returns all the values of that players statistics.  When we pivot it the name of the statistic will
      return that single value which we will then filter by the player.</p>
      <p>Some may be asking now, "Well why can't we just turn the measures into a dimension inside tableau?"
      Well sometimes you could, but in this case it will just turn the value in that measure into a dimension.  So
      instead of grouping by the statistic name itself it will group by the value of that statistic.  This is why
      we need the statistic names to be grouped into one column which allows us to subgroup them as needed in the
      chart. So how do we get those column names into one column? That brings us back to pivoting the data.</p>
      <h2><b>How to Pivot:</b></h2>
      <p>Pivoting in Tableau is incredibly easy. All one has to do is select the columns that you want pivoted
      on the data source screen, then click on the little arrow and select pivot like in the picture below:
      <div class='fitimage'>
        <img  src='img/pivoting.png' alt='Pivoting menu'>
      </div>
      <br />
      <p>This will pivot all the stat columns into two columns: Pivot Values and Pivot Names. Which in return will
      result in your data looking something like this:
      <div class='fitimage'>
        <img  src='img/pivotresults.png' alt='Pivoting menu'>
      </div>
      <br />
      <p>And that's it! So now that we have the data ready to go let's move on to making the actual graph.
      <h2><b>Creating the Graph:</b></h2>
      <p>Ok to create our beginning table graph I'm going to drag the Pivot Values pill to the Columns shelf and Pivot
      Field Names to the Rows Shelf.  Next I will drag our Players pill to the Filters shelf, select show the filter
      from the dropdown menu, and then change that filter to a drop down menu itself. If you are unsure how to do this
      the <a href='tableau.html'>first tutorial</a> will cover how to create a filter. Once you've done all that you
      will have a graph that looks like this:
      <div class='fitimage'>
        <img  src='img/firstgraph.png' alt='First graph'>
      </div>
      <br />
      <p>The titles for the bar graphs will be different than yours but that's because I've already created aliases for
      them which we'll go over in a minute.  So now that we have the main graph created it's time to create the groups
      as seen in Andi's tableau dashboard. The first step to doing that is right clicking on the Pivot Field Names pill
      selecting Create from the menu and then selecting Group.
      <div class='fitimage'>
        <img  src='img/group.png' alt='Finding Group Menu'>
      </div>
      <br />
      <p>This will then pull up the group menu that looks like this:</p>
      <div class='fitimage'>
        <img  src='img/groupmenu.png' alt='Group Menu'>
      </div>
      <br />
      <p>Now all you do is simply select the stats you want to group, hit the group button, and then name your Group.
      Repeat until you have all the stats grouped as you want them.
      <div class='fitimage'>
        <img  src='img/groupinprogress.png' alt='Group Menu'>
      </div>
      <br />
      <p>Once you have all your groups created then you drag the Group pill in front of the Pivot Field Names
      on the rows shelf which leads to a graph looking like this:
      <div class='fitimage'>
        <img  src='img/finalgraph.png' alt='Final Graph'>
      </div>
      <br />
      <p>Once thats done you can drag and drop the categories and stats to place them in the order that you want.
      And with that last step you've now created what is called a heirarchical data structure just in Tableau alone!
      If you don't know what that means its fine, but if you're familiar with working with dataframes in Python and
      R you probably do. It's beyond the scope of this tutorial but is a phrase to keep in mind as you'll probably
      read about it in other writings, and it will be something I'll cover in future writings.
      <h2><b>Creating the Aliases:</b></h2>
      <p>So with the groupings created now all that's left to finish the graph is to change the stat names
      by changing their aliases.  Alias is a term that you'll see over and over again in Tableau.  Any time
      you want to change the name of a dropdown menu, or a statistic that appears in the graph, you'll want
      to look for the Alias option in the menu.  We'll get to ours by right clicking the Pivot Field Names
      and selecting Alias from the menu. That will then give us a menu like this:
      <div class='fitimage'>
        <img  src='img/alias.png' alt='Final Graph'>
      </div>
      <br />
      <p>Just click on the value in the Alias column and change it to whatever you want.  Now you are finished
      your first grouped data data viz! I'll go over turning this into a simple comparison dashboard in the
      next <a href='dashboard.html'>tutorial.</a> The dashboard put together can be found
      <a href='https://public.tableau.com/views/testing_144/Dashboard1?:embed=y&:display_count=yes'>here.</a>
      It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of a finished graph but it will give you a solid framework
      on which to build upon if you are building a data visualition like this in the future.</p>
