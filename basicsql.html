      <h2>Basic SQL Commands</h2>
      <h2> by Matthew Barlowe</h2>
      <br />
      <p>Ok if you've read the <a href='sqlstart.html'>first tutorial</a> on installing Postgres
      and getting your first database up and running, you're now wondering "So how do I access all
      this data?" Well that's where this tutorial comes in as we are going to cover some of the basic
      commands in SQL to get the data we want. Ok let's get started and dive right in to our data.
      <h2>SELECT</h2>
      <p>The <code>SELECT</code> command is going to be your workhorse command when working with
      SQL. It's the command that tells Postgres to pull the data from the table and return it to you
      so you can use it. The <code>SELECT</code> is always paired with a <code>FROM</code> clause
      so you can tell Postgres exactly what table you want to select your data. Let's take a look
      at the command I used at the end of the first tutorial:</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
SELECT * FROM playerstats LIMIT 1;
      </code></pre>
      <p>Ok let's break it down piece by piece. <code>SELECT</code> tells Postgres that we want to
      pull data. The <code>*</code> tells Postgres that we want the data from every column in the
      table. You can choose whatever columns you want the data from and it doesn't have to be all of
      them, but this example we are taking all of them. Next is the <code>FROM</code> clause that tells
      Postgres we want to pull all the columns from the <code>playerstats</code> table.</p>
      <p>If you have multiple tables you would change the name of the table to whatever table you wanted
      data from. But right now all we have is the <code>playerstats</code> so that's the one we will
      be using for the rest of this tutorial. The <code>LIMIT</code> clause while technically not needed
      for a <code>SELECT</code> query is very important here. If we had just entered in the command without
      using the <code>LIMIT</code> Postgres would have returned every single row in the table and you almost
      never want that. So I added the <code>LIMIT</code> clause and passed it the number 1 telling Postgres
      to limit the results to 1 row. Pretty simple eh?</p>
      <p>Ok lets do a couple other <code>SELECT</code> queries to get the hang of it. First though
      lets get a list of the columns in our table with the <code>\d+ playerstats</code> which will produce
      and output similar to this:
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
    Column    |  Type   | Collation | Nullable | Default | Storage  | Stats target | Description
--------------+---------+-----------+----------+---------+----------+--------------+-------------
 player       | text    |           |          |         | extended |              |
 team         | text    |           |          |         | extended |              |
 toi          | real    |           |          |         | plain    |              |
 cf           | real    |           |          |         | plain    |              |
 ca           | real    |           |          |         | plain    |              |
 c_plus_minus | real    |           |          |         | plain    |              |
 ff           | real    |           |          |         | plain    |              |
 fa           | real    |           |          |         | plain    |              |
      </code></pre>
      <p>So now we have some columns lets adjust our <code>SELECT</code> statement to just include a few
      of them instead of all of them:</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
SELECT player, game_date, team, cf, ca, c_plus_minus FROM playerstats LIMIT 10;
      </code></pre>
      <p>Which will produce an output similar to this:</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
       player      | game_date  | team | cf | ca | c_plus_minus

(10 rows)
      </code></pre>
      <p>You can play around with the columns as much as you want and see the different outputs.
      So now we're getting some more info that is something we can work with but nothing we can actually
      draw insights from. The next clause though will help us narrow our data even more.</p>
      <h2>WHERE</h2>
      <p>So above we learned how to limit the columns the SQL query returns so now lets learn how to
      limit the rows that are returned. This is done in SQL by using the <code>WHERE</code> clause
      with your <code>SELECT</code>. <code>WHERE</code> gives your an SQL query a condition that it
      checks every row against in the table and if the condition is met it returns the row and if it
      isn't then the row is excluded. Let's look at it in action:
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
SELECT player, game_date, team, cf, ca, c_plus_minus FROM playerstats
WHERE team='CAR' LIMIT 10;
      </code></pre>
      <p>Now there is a order in whcih clauses go where in the SQL queries. Generally its SELECT, FROM,
      WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, LIMIT. So when playing around with your queries if you don't stick
      to the order Postgres will throw an error. Obviously you don't know what all of those clauses do, but
      just keep in mind for now that <code>WHERE</code> clauses will go before Limit clauses. So if you ran
      command above this should be your output:</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
          player      | game_date  | team | cf | ca | c_plus_minus
----------------------+------------+------+----+----+--------------
       ANDREJ.SEKERA   | 2014-11-16 | CAR  | 40 | 18 |           22
       ANTON.KHUDOBIN  | 2014-11-16 | CAR  | 84 | 44 |           40
       BRAD.MALONE     | 2014-11-16 | CAR  | 11 |  9 |            2
       BRETT.BELLEMORE | 2014-11-16 | CAR  | 22 | 14 |            8
       CHRIS.TERRY     | 2014-11-16 | CAR  | 23 |  8 |           15
       ELIAS.LINDHOLM  | 2014-11-16 | CAR  | 27 | 16 |           11
       ERIC.STAAL      | 2014-11-16 | CAR  | 37 | 14 |           23
       JAY.MCCLEMENT   | 2014-11-16 | CAR  |  7 |  9 |           -2
       JEFF.SKINNER    | 2014-11-16 | CAR  | 35 | 12 |           23
       JIRI.TLUSTY     | 2014-11-16 | CAR  | 28 | 14 |           14
(10 rows)
      </code></pre>
      <p>If you're a Carolina fan some of those names will make you cringe, but as you can see where before
      Buffalo was the first ten rows returned now the first ten rows returned will only be rows where the
      <code>team</code> column is equal to <code>CAR</code>. You can also chain these commands as well using
      logical switches such as AND or OR like so:
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
SELECT player, game_date, team, cf, ca, c_plus_minus FROM playerstats
WHERE team='CAR' AND game_date > '2018-02-01' LIMIT 10;
      </code></pre>
      <p>This will give us all the rows where the <code>team</code> is 'CAR' and the <code>game_date</code> is after
      Feburary 2nd, 2018. There are many more ways to combine these as well to help select the data that you are looking
      for but this is the basics. There will be a lot of trial and error at the beginning as you get
      used to it so don't despair and just keep at it.
      <h2>Aggregate Functions</h2>
      <p>Ok so we've learned how to select the appropriate columns and rows that we want from our data, but
      how do we look at the overall picture? How do we look at say the total goals scored or assists earned over
      a season or even a certain time frame? This is done with our powerful aggregate functions and the
      <code>GROUP BY</code>.</p>
      <p>As you can see with the data each row is an individual game for an individual player so just using
      <code>WHERE</code>won't tell you the whole story. So let's try and see if we can calculate the
      goals and assists for Jeff Skinner for the 2018 season. We'll do that by using an SQL query that looks
      like this:</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
SELECT player, sum(g), sum(a1), sum(a2) FROM playerstats
WHERE player='JEFF.SKINNER' AND game_date > '2017-10-01' GROUP BY player;
      </code></pre>
      <p>Just a warning this won't be correct since we are using the data from my data dump that stopped
      at the end of February this is just to show you the syntax. Which should make this the output:</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
    player    | sum | sum | sum
--------------+-----+-----+-----
 JEFF.SKINNER |  20 |   9 |   8
(1 row)
      </code></pre>
      <p>Well those column names aren't very helpful. However there is a simple way to change that using the <code>AS</code>
      command in your query:
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
SELECT player, sum(g) AS goals, sum(a1) AS a1, sum(a2) AS a2
FROM playerstats WHERE player='JEFF.SKINNER' AND game_date > '2017-10-01'
GROUP BY player;
      </code></pre>
      <p>And now your output looks much nicer:</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
    player    | goals | a1 | a2
--------------+-------+----+----
 JEFF.SKINNER |    20 |  9 |  8
(1 row)
      </code></pre>
      <p>All <code>AS</code> does is just create an alias for the column. You can do this with any column you want
      along with tables as well. It just creates another name for something that you can refer to later on in the query.
      This won't work with <code>WHERE</code> statements because the <code>WHERE</code> clause references the raw data
      and your alias is created after the fact.</p>
      <p>There several aggregate functions in SQL with the most common being <code>sum, avg, min, max, count</code>. Respectively
      those add the values, average the values, find the minimum value, the maximum value, and last counts the number of values i.e.
      the of rows in a column.</p>
      <p>The next and most important part of an aggregate function is the <code>GROUP BY</code> clause. This tells
      Postgres how we want to calculate the aggregate functions. If we left out the <code>player</code> column then
      the functions would just sum the total goals and assists of every player after the date we gave it. <code>GROUP BY</code>
      though allows us to tell Postgres that we want to group the sums by each player. So Postgres will then group the
      rows together by each individual player then sum the goals and assists and return those totals for each player
      creating one row where once there where many. Let's take a look at our old command but this time we won't limit
      it to Jeff Skinner.
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
SELECT player, sum(g) AS goals, sum(a1) AS a1, sum(a2) AS a2
FROM playerstats WHERE game_date > '2017-10-01'
GROUP BY player LIMIT 10;
      </code></pre>
      <p>And this will be the output:</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
      player       | goals | a1 | a2

      </code></pre>
      <p>As you can see we are now calculating the goal and assist totals for all players in our time frame. I added a <code>LIMIT</code>
      clause or else it would return every NHL player during that time frame. <code>GROUP BY</code> doesn't just work
      for players we can use it on the <code>team</code> column as well or any other categorical column in your database.
      In this one that is just mainly our teams and players, but if you were working with another database with
      different categorical columns <code>GROUP BY</code> would work just as well on those with calculating aggregate
      stats. If you have some experinece with pandas or R dataframes <code>GROUP BY</code> in SQL works basically the same
      as <code>.groupby</code> and <code>group_by</code> respectively in those langauges.</p>
      <h2>ORDER BY</h2>
      <p>Ok the last command we'll look at in this tutorial is the <code>ORDER BY</code> clause in our select statements.
      <code>ORDER BY</code> just tells Postgres by what column we want to order our data when it is returned to us. So using
      last command above:
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
SELECT player, sum(g) AS goals, sum(a1) AS a1, sum(a2) AS a2
FROM playerstats WHERE game_date > '2017-10-01'
GROUP BY player ORDER BY goals LIMIT 10;
      </code></pre>
      <p>Which produces this output:</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
      player       | goals | a1 | a2
-------------------+-------+----+----
 CAL.O'REILLY      |     0 |  0 |  0

 BRANDON.HALVERSON |     0 |  0 |  0
 MADISON.BOWEY     |     0 |  4 |  8
 ANTTI.NIEMI       |     0 |  0 |  1
 MIKE.BLUNDEN      |     0 |  0 |  0
(10 rows)
      </code></pre>
      <p>Well that's really no fun but is an important lesson. <code>ORDER BY</code> always sorts in ascending order.
      So it will always sort from the smallest value in the column to the largest unless we tell it otherwise. To do
      that all you need to do is add the <code>DESC</code> flag to your order by statement like so:</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
SELECT player, sum(g) AS goals, sum(a1) AS a1, sum(a2) AS a2
FROM playerstats WHERE game_date > '2017-10-01'
GROUP BY player ORDER BY goals DESC LIMIT 10;
      </code></pre>
      <p>Which gives us this output:</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
      player      | goals | a1 | a2
------------------+-------+----+----

(10 rows)
      </code></pre>
      <p>And now we have the top ten goal scorers over the time frame we passed our SQL query. And just with a
      few simple commands you can start to do some actual analysis of hockey stats. Remember these are just
      the basics of all these commands. With experience you'll be able to slice and dice the data
      however you want. Stil with the basics learned here you can do a lot of research and start to get
      the hang of how SQL queries are structured.</p>
