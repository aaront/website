        <h1>Twitter Bot Commands</h1>
        <br />
        <p style='font-size:24px'>I have written a brief tutorial on how to
        query the twitter bot so that it will return the statistics or graphs
        you want.  If you have any questions please feel free to email me or
        contact me on <a href='https://twitter.com/barloweanalytic'>twitter.</a></p>
        <p>There are two types of queries that the bot will provide.
        They are divided into statistical queries and graph queries.
        As of right now the statistical query will return the season
        values of CF%, xGF%, and ixG for players and CF% and xGF% for
        teams.  For the graphs it will return a 5 game moving average
        over the season for players and teams for these values, and
        these values only as of right now:</p>
        <h3>Statistics the Bot will Graph:</h3>
        <p>toi | cf | ca | c_plus_minus | ff | fa | xgf | xga |
        gf | ga | g | a1 | a2 | ixg | cf60 | ca60 | cf_percent |
        ff60 | fa60 | ff_percent | gf60 | ga60 | gf_percent | xgf60
        | xga60 | xgf_percent | g60 | a160 | a260 | p60 | ixg60</p>
        <p>C stands for Corsi, F for Fenwick, and xg stands for expected goals
        which uses my method detailed here
        <a href='https://rpubs.com/mcbarlowe/xGmodel'>here.</a>
        The stats and player names must be spelled EXACTLY as listed
        above to properly process your query.  Also player names
        should be spelled correctly as well.  There is no fuzzy searching
        implemented for this bot yet so if you can’t spell Marchessault
        then you aren’t getting his stats, at least from here.</p>
        <p>In addition you can flag the query to return values adjusted
        for score and venue with the ‘-adj’ flag and for 5v5 only with the
        ‘-5v5’ flag.  Listed below are the entire examples that the bot
        will take and return a value.  They have to be entered in that
        order and the -adj and -5v5 flags are optional. If you are
        familiar with terminal or cmd line commands these are
        structured in a very similar way.  Any misspellings,
        any words out of order will cause your request not to be processed.
        The ‘vs.’ keyword will return the graph/stats of two
        teams/players and is necessary for that effect to happen.</p>
