        <h1>Twitter Bot Commands</h1>
        <br />
        <p style='font-size:24px'>I have written a brief tutorial on how to
        query the twitter bot so that it will return the statistics or graphs
        you want.  If you have any questions please feel free to email me or
        contact me on <a href='https://twitter.com/barloweanalytic'>twitter.</a></p>
        <p>There are two types of queries that the bot will provide.
        They are divided into statistical queries and graph queries.
        As of right now the statistical query will return the season
        values of CF%, xGF%, and ixG for players and CF% and xGF% for
        teams.  For the graphs it will return a 5 game moving average
        over the season for players and teams for these values, and
        these values only as of right now:</p>
        <h3>Statistics the Bot will Graph:</h3>
        <p>toi | cf | ca | c_plus_minus | ff | fa | xgf | xga |
        gf | ga | g | a1 | a2 | ixg | cf60 | ca60 | cf_percent |
        ff60 | fa60 | ff_percent | gf60 | ga60 | gf_percent | xgf60
        | xga60 | xgf_percent | g60 | a160 | a260 | p60 | ixg60</p>
        <p>C stands for Corsi, F for Fenwick, and xg stands for expected goals
        which uses my method detailed here
        <a href='https://rpubs.com/mcbarlowe/xGmodel'>here.</a>
        The stats and player names must be spelled EXACTLY as listed
        above to properly process your query.  Also player names
        should be spelled correctly as well.  There is no fuzzy searching
        implemented for this bot yet so if you can’t spell Marchessault
        then you aren’t getting his stats, at least from here. Also the team
        names are the same abbreviations that you will find on
        <a href='corsica.hockey'>Corsica</a></p>
        <p>In addition you can flag the query to return values adjusted
        for score and venue with the ‘-adj’ flag and for 5v5 only with the
        ‘-5v5’ flag.  Listed below are the entire examples that the bot
        will take and return a value.  They have to be entered in that
        order and the -adj and -5v5 flags are optional. If you are
        familiar with terminal or cmd line commands these are
        structured in a very similar way.  Any misspellings,
        any words out of order will cause your request not to be processed.
        The ‘vs.’ keyword will return the graph/stats of two
        teams/players and is necessary for that effect to happen.</p>
        <h3>Examples:</h3>
        <h5>Stat Query Examples</h5>
        <p style='font-size:16px'><b>@barloweanalytic Justin Faulk playerstats 2018 -adj -5v5</b></p>
        <p>This will return the 5v5 score venue adjusted values of Justin Faulk’s CF%, xGF%, and ixG</p>
        <p style='font-size:16px'><b>@barloweanalytic Car teamstats 2018 -adj -5v5</b></p>
        <p>This will return the Carolina hurricanes CF% and xGF% score venue adjusted and at 5v5.</p>
        <p>If you wanted either of those unadjusted you would type
        the same query and leave out the ‘-adj’ flag and if you
        wanted all situations you would do the same with the ‘5v5’ flag</p>
        <p style='font-size:16px'><b>@barloweanalytic Justin Faulk vs. Jeff Skinner playerstats 2018</b></p>
        <p>This will return both the stats for Faulk and Skinner.
        If you want to adjust them add the appropriate flags</p>
        <h5>Graph examples</h5>
        <p style='font-size:16px'><b>@barloweanalytic Justin Faulk player graph cf_percent 2018 -adj -5v5</b></p>
        <p>This will return the graph of a 5 game rolling average of Justin Faulk’s CF% adjusted and 5v5 only</p>
        <p style='font-size:16px'><b>@barloweanalytic Justin Faulk vs. Jeff Skinner player graph cf_percent 2018 -adj -5v5</b></p>
        <p>This will do the same as above but also graph Jeff Skinner’s stats as well</p>
        <p style='font-size:16px'><b>@barloweanalytic CAR team graph cf_percent 2018 -adj -5v5</b></p>
        <p>As above but now for the Carolina Hurricanes</p>

        <p style='font-size:16px'><b>@barloweanalytic Car vs. PIT graph cf_percent 2018 -adj -5v5</b></p>
        <p>Just like with the Carolina graph above but will also plot Pittsburgh’s cf% values over the season as well</p>
        <h3>Last things:</h3>
        <p>The player names and team names are case insensitive everything
        else should be lower case.  If the bot doesn’t respond that means
        you made an error in your query and should double check and try again.
        If you feel that your query is correct and something is wrong please
        contact me through twitter or email barloweanalytics@gmail.com</p>

        <h3>Team Abbreviations</h3>
        <p>ANA ARI BOS BUF CAR CBJ CGY CHI COL DAL DET EDM FLA L.A MIN MTL N.J
        NSH NYI NYR OTT PHI PIT S.J STL T.B TOR VAN VGK WPG WSH

        <p>Would also like to think Emannuel Perry for his
        <a href='https://github.com/mannyelk/corsica/blob/master/modules/dryscrape.R'>game scraper</a>
        and Harry Shomer for his <a href='https://github.com/HarryShomer/Hockey-Scraper'>
          scraper</a> as well.  Without either of these guys this project would
        not be possible so a big thanks goes to them for writing the programs
        used to compile the NHL pbp data that I then convert into stats that the
        bot can access to fulfill the queries.</p>
