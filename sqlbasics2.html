      <h2>SQL Basics Part 2</h2>
      <h2> by Matthew Barlowe</h2>
      <br />
      <p>Ok if you've been following these in order our <a href='basicsql.html'>last tutorial</a>
      covered on the <code>SELECT</code> SQL command and some of the clauses associated with it.
      I however negelected to mention two more important clause I commonly use and that you will
      find useful to add to your repertoire.
      <h2>HAVING</h2>
      <p>The clause we are going to look at is the <code>HAVING</code> clause. If you remember
      at the end of the last tutorial linked above we were dealing with agregate functions. But
      what if you want to limit the rows returned in a <code>SELCT</code> query based on the value
      returned by the aggregate function? Let's refresh our memory and look at one of these queries
      first:</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
SELECT player, sum(g) AS goals, sum(a1) AS a1, sum(a2) AS a2
FROM playerstats WHERE game_date > '2017-10-01'
GROUP BY player ORDER BY goals DESC;
      </code></pre>
      <p>Ok say we only wanted to see goal scorers that have scored over 30 goals instead of
      all the goal scorers in the NHL. If you tried to put that in a <code>WHERE</code> clause
      Postgres would throw an error. That's because, if you remember from last tutorial, that
      the <code>WHERE</code> clause acts before the <code>sum()</code>. <code>WHERE</code> won't
      know what goals is at all because in the order of operations it will look for <code>goals</code>
      before you have even declared it.</p>
      <p>"What if we just passed it <code>WHERE g > 30</code>? That should work right?" Nope,
      because as we are working with individual games you won't find a single player who
      has scored 30 goals in a game so the <code>WHERE</code> will just exclude all rows
      and return an empty table.</p>
      <p>This is where the <code>HAVING</code> clause comes in play. <code>HAVING</code> is like
      a <code>WHERE</code> clause but it comes after the agregate functions are run. So lets change
      our query from above:</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
SELECT player, sum(g) AS goals, sum(a1) AS a1, sum(a2) AS a2
FROM playerstats WHERE game_date > '2017-10-01'
GROUP BY player HAVING sum(g) > 30 ORDER BY goals DESC;
      </code></pre>
      <p>And this will be your result:</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
       player       | goals | a1 | a2

(16 rows)
      </code></pre>
      <p>So now we have all the goal scorers who have score more than 30 goals in our time frame
      we passed to the SQL query. The only way you will be able to filter future aggregate functions
      will be with the <code>HAVING</code> command so make sure to keep it in mind. Another thing
      I will mention is that the <code>HAVING</code> command is executed before the <code>SELECT</code>
      command so it won't have any knowledge of the aliases you have created. This means that
      you will need to pass it the whole aggregate function in order to filter the results as desired.</p>
      <h2>BETWEEN</h2>
      <p>Ok our last introductory command/clause for basic select statements is going to be the
      <code>BETWEEN</code> clause. So using our command above we are going to limit the total goals
      between the values of 20 and 25 like so:
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
SELECT player, sum(g) AS goals, sum(a1) AS a1, sum(a2) AS a2
FROM playerstats WHERE game_date > '2017-10-01'
GROUP BY player HAVING sum(g) BETWEEN 20 and 25 ORDER BY goals DESC;
      </code></pre>
      <p>Here are our results:</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
             player       | goals | a1 | a2

 ALEX.RADULOV       |    25 | 24 | 14

 SEBASTIAN.AHO      |    25 | 20 | 12
 CLAUDE.GIROUX      |    25 | 30 | 26
 BRAYDEN.SCHENN     |    25 | 19 | 16
 EVANDER.KANE       |    25 | 12 | 13
      </code></pre>
      <p>This isn't the whole selection as the result you should get will be 30 rows but as you see
      the top is 30 and the bottom is 25. That's because <code>BETWEEN</code> is inclusive. Now you
      could have done the same thing like this <code>HAVING sum(g)<=30 AND sum(g)>=25</code> but
      I feel that <code>BETWEEN</code> is much easier to use. Not only that its much easier to read
      and for others to interpret what your code is doing which is something you should always have
      in the back of your mind as you are writing it.</p>
      <p><code>BETWEEN</code> just doesn't work with <code>HAVING</code> you can also use it with
      your <code>WHERE</code> clauses as well and in the exact same way. Say if we wanted to look at
      goals scored in the month of October last year we would use <code>WHERE game_date BETWEEN
        '2017-10-01' and '2017-10-31'</code> and it would limit the games we passed to our
      <code>GROUP BY</code> clause to those that occured in October only.</p>
