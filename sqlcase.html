      <h2>SQL CASE and Sub Queries </h2>
      <h2> by Matthew Barlowe</h2>
      <br />
      <p>Ok if you've been following along with my SQL tutorials you should
      now have a pretty good grasp of how to make queries and get the data
      you need. However, the data is still the data. You can use aggregate
      functions to sum or count things, but so far you've been limited in
      actually creating new data itself with your <code>SELECT</code>
      statements.</p>
      <p>But what if you wanted to create a new group to denote say what
      line a player would play on on an NHL team? The way to do that is
      with a <code>CASE</code> SQL statement. If you are familiar with other
      programming languages, then a <code>CASE</code> clause is similar to
      and <code>IF/THEN</code> statement or <code>IF/ELSE</code> for
      those that may be more familiar with R or Python.</p>
      <p><code>CASE</code> allows you to set conditions on your data and
      if the data meets those conditions then it assigns the data a label.
      Reading that may not make any sense but once you see it in action
      everything will hopefully be a little clearer. So like the example
      above lets try and determine the lines of a team from our
      <code>playerstats</code> database. If you don't have that setup I
      suggest visting my <a href='sqlstart.html'>Postgres Setup</a>
      tutorial and also the SQL Basics <a href='basicsql.html'>Part 1</a>
      and <a href='sqlbasics2.html'>Part 2</a>.</p>
      <p>Ok let's look at the query we are going to use to determine that:
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
SELECT *,
  CASE WHEN toi_per_gp &lt; 11 THEN 4
       WHEN toi_per_gp between 11 and 14 THEN 3
       WHEN toi_per_gp between 14 and 17 THEN 2
       ELSE 1 END AS line
FROM
  (SELECT player, team, sum(toi) as toi, sum(g) as goals,
  sum(a1 + a2) as assists, count(player) as GP,
  trunc((sum(toi)/sum(gp)))::numeric, 2) as toi_per_gp
  FROM playerstats where season = '20172018' GROUP BY player, team) as stats
WHERE team = 'CAR' ORDER BY line DESC;
      </code></pre>
      <p>This query will then return results like this:</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
       player        | team |   toi   | goals | assists | gp | toi_per_gp | line

      </code></pre>
      <p>And you can see by the results we've group each player into a line
      by their TOI per game played. Obviously there's nothing exact about these
      groupings in fact they are rather arbitrary bins, but it definitely helps
      you see quickly which players are more favored by their coach and which
      ones are not.</p>
      <p>So now we've got out results let's break this query
      down piece by piece since it includes
      a lot of things you haven't seen before in the other tutorials. The first
      thing we'll look at (and the other main part of the title) is the
      second <code>SELECT</code> statment in the query</p>
      <p>'What is that?' you may be asking yourself because if you've
      followed along with the tutorials all you've seen so far are queries
      with just one <code>SELECT</code> in each query. This is what is known
      as a sub query, or sub <code>SELECT</code>, and is a critical concept
      to add to your SQL toolbox.</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
FROM
  (SELECT player, team, sum(toi) as toi, sum(g) as goals,
  sum(a1 + a2) as assists, count(player) as GP,
  trunc((sum(toi)/sum(gp))::numeric, 2) as toi_per_gp
  FROM playerstats where season = '20172018' GROUP BY player, team) as stats
WHERE team = 'CAR' ORDER BY line DESC;
      </code></pre>
      <p>This part above is the actual subquery of the query in question.
      Usually subqueries are contained in parenthesis and after them
      is a name that will be used as an alias to refer to the subquery in other
      parts of the original query</p>
      <p>So a subquery is just another query that you execute before you pass
      it to the original query you want to execute. Oftentimes in an SQL
      database the data will not be in the perfect form you need it to be.
      So in order to shape the data into the from you need it to be you'll
      execute a sub query to create a new table on which you'll then
      execute functions or in this instance our <code>CASE</code> statement</p>
      <p>Basically what I'm doing with my sub query is I'm creating a brand
      new table that I will then <code>SELECT</code> from to creat my results.
      In this case I'm creating a new table from which I am then selecting
      from to run my <code>CASE</code> statement on. One way to determine if
      you are working with a subquery is that it will always be encased
      in parentheses.</p>
      <p>Inside those parentheses is just a standard <code>SELECT</code> you've
      seen plenty of times before, but there are a couple of new things I want
      to go over first. First is the <code>trunc((sum(toi)/sum(gp))::numeric, 2)</code>
      statement. <code>trunc</code> is a function that is short for truncate which
      means shorten. Basically what we are doing here is rounding the results of
      our <code>sum(toi)/sum(gp)</code> statement.
      <p>However in Postgres <code>trunc</code> needs a <code>numeric</code>
      input. If you remember back when we were creating out table schemas
      we had to define what value type each column would be. In Postgres
      <code>numeric</code> is one of those value types. Unlike <code>real</code>
      value types <code>numeric</code> in postgres is allowed to have a user
      defined percision hence the reason its needed for the <code>trunc</code>
      function. The way we change our the <code>real</code> results to a
      numerice is with the <code>::</code> operator.</p>
      <p>The double colons allows us to cast the type of the column, i.e. what
      data format it is, to another within our <code>SELECT</code> query. In
      this instance if we didn't cast the results of our division to a
      <code>numeric</code> type the SQL would return an error.</p>
      <h2>CASE Statement</h2>
      <p>Ok let's move on to the second part of this article and look at the
      <code>CASE</code> statement part of the query as you see below.</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
SELECT *,
  CASE WHEN toi_per_gp &lt; 11 THEN 4
       WHEN toi_per_gp between 11 and 14 THEN 3
       WHEN toi_per_gp between 14 and 17 THEN 2
       ELSE 1 END AS line
      </code></pre>
      <p>Ok the <code>*</code> you've seen before that just means pull all the
      columns of the table we are feeding our <code>FROM</code> clause. But in
      addition to that we are adding the <code>CASE</code> statement to calculate
      what line the players are on by their ice time per game played. So if you
      look at the sub query above <code>toi_per_gp</code> was the column where we
      calculated a players average TOI per game.</p>
      <p>Using that column will pass it's values to our <code>CASE</code> clause.
      The syntax for a <code>CASE</code> statement in Postgres follows this syntax:
      <code>CASE WHEN logical_statement THEN value ELSE another_value END new_column_name</code>.
      The <code>CASE</code> checks to see if the value in the logical statement
      is true and if so it puts the <code>value</code> in the <code>new_column_name</code>
      column for that row. If it's not true then it will place <code>another_value</code>.</p>
      <p>You can chain the <code>WHEN</code> statements as I've done above to create
      multiple conditions and the resultant values that will be put in the new
      column we are creating. The code above looks at the <code>toi_per_gp</code> if
      that value is less than 11 it places a 4 in the <code>line</code> column, if its
      between 11 and 14 minutes then they are third liners and so on.</p>
      <p>The last part of the statement is the <code>ELSE</code> clause. This lets you assign
      a value for that row in the column whenever none of the logical conditions you
      set have been met. In our example if a player didn't meet any of the conditions
      he would be playing over 17 minutes a night on average which allows us to just
      call him a first liner without even checking. It's just a catch all for all the
      values you don't need to set a specific check for. If you plan only every value
      being caught in your logical checks then you don't even need, but most of the time
      that won't be true.</p>
      <p>The conditions that you are checking for in a <code>CASE</code> statement
      can be whatever you want them to be. You can check to see if a value in a column
      is a certain phrase, or if the sum of two different columns is greater than another
      column; it's up to you but any time you need to do a logical check in SQL
      then <code>CASE</code> is the tool you need.
