      <h2>SQL Basics Part 3</h2>
      <h2> by Matthew Barlowe</h2>
      <br />
      <p>Ok last time I was talking about <code>SELECT</code> clauses I discussed
      using <code>OR</code> operator to dictate two states in your <code>WHERE</code>
      clause that would filter the results. Well with this tutorial I'm going to show
      you a little shortcut for when you want to set multiple filters on the query results.</p>
      <h2>Using the IN Operator</h2>
      <p>Ok let's look at the last query from the <a href='sqlbasics2.html'>last tutorial</a>:
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
SELECT player, sum(g) AS goals, sum(a1) AS a1, sum(a2) AS a2
FROM playerstats WHERE game_date > '2017-10-01'
GROUP BY player HAVING sum(g) BETWEEN 20 and 25 ORDER BY goals DESC;
      </code></pre>
      <p>Ok if you remember that returned the players who had scored between 20 and 25 goals
      in the data after 10/01/2017. But let's say we wanted to see only the results from a
      few teams instead of all the teams. We could chain together a bunch of <code>OR</code>
      statements, but we don't want to do that.</p>
      <p>Not only would that make for a harder to read SQL query, it would also be more typing
      and I'm never a fan of typing more than I have to. So lets change the query to show us
      only the goal scorers from the Flyers, the Rangers, and Carolina.</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
SELECT player, sum(g) AS goals, sum(a1) AS a1, sum(a2) AS a2
FROM playerstats WHERE game_date > '2017-10-01' AND team IN ('PHI', 'NYR', 'CAR')
GROUP BY player HAVING sum(g) BETWEEN 20 and 25 ORDER BY goals DESC;
      </code></pre>
      <p>This will produce a result that looks like this:</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
     player      | goals | a1 | a2
-----------------+-------+----+----
 MICHAEL.GRABNER |    25 |  4 |  2
 SEBASTIAN.AHO   |    21 | 15 | 10
 CLAUDE.GIROUX   |    20 | 26 | 24
 WAYNE.SIMMONDS  |    20 | 10 |  7
 JEFF.SKINNER    |    20 |  9 |  8
(5 rows)
      </code></pre>
      <p>As you can see we have limited our results to just those teams in the <code>IN</code>.
      Remember once again this data only goes up to the end of February so it won't have known that
      Grabner was traded to the New Jersey Devils. And even if it was up to date since each row
      is a single game it would still return Grabner's stats as a Ranger since he scored over
      20 goals. It would not return any data from his New Jersey games though as the team wouldn't be
      one of the teams in the <code>IN</code> list.</p>
      <p><code>IN</code> will work for any column that is categorical such as team name, player name, and
      game date. It will also work for numerical columns as well just return the rows where the value
      is in the <code>IN</code> list. So if you wanted to look at games say for players where they scored
      two goals you would adjust the query like this:</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
SELECT player, sum(g) AS goals, sum(a1) AS a1, sum(a2) AS a2
FROM playerstats WHERE game_date > '2017-10-01' AND g IN (2)
GROUP BY player ORDER BY goals DESC;
      </code></pre>
      <p>And it would return results like this:</p>
      <pre><code class='Command Line'>
            player      | goals | a1 | a2
------------------+-------+----+----
 SEAN.COUTURIER   |    12 |  1 |  1
 RICK.NASH        |     8 |  0 |  1
 MICHAEL.GRABNER  |     6 |  0 |  0
 TEUVO.TERAVAINEN |     6 |  2 |  0
 SEBASTIAN.AHO    |     6 |  1 |  0
 TAYLOR.HALL      |     6 |  1 |  0
 SCOTT.LAUGHTON   |     4 |  0 |  0
 CHRIS.KREIDER    |     4 |  1 |  0
 JEFF.SKINNER     |     4 |  0 |  0
 NICO.HISCHIER    |     4 |  0 |  1
(10 rows)
      </code></pre>
      <p>So as you can see the <code>IN</code> operator is a very powerful way to slice your data
      while remaining easy to work. If you have many different categories to need to filter for
      than <code>IN</code> probably isn't the best choice and you need to find more efficient solutions
      such as <code>JOIN</code>. Still it's a good tool to keep handy and will be one you use
      regularly.</p>
